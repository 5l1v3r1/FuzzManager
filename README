== FuzzManager ==

With this project, we aim to create a management toolchain for fuzzing. The 
first goal is to solve the processing of massive results as a consequence of 
scaling fuzzing into the cloud. Therefore we want to implement:

* A server that stores crash information, supports bucketing, inspection and 
  bug tracker interoperability
* A client that can process various forms of crash information, create and 
  match signatures as well as submit crash information to the server

Note that this project is not in a usable state yet. We decided to start the 
development in the open to address compatibility issues as soon as possible.
